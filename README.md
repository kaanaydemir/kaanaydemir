# 💫 About Me:
Hi there! I'm a software developer with experience in Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Oracle, and MS SQL. I also hold an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certificate. I enjoy building scalable and reliable software systems that solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading books or playing video games.
